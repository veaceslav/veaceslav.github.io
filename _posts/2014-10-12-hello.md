Hello, and welcome to my new blog. Because Github offers a student pack with a lot of free stuff,
I decided to get a new domain name. Aaand, now I own veaceslav.me which is awesome. With a new domain name
I could link to my old wordpress blog, but I decided to give a try to a different platform.

And now I'm on Github pages. This platform is not the best for everybody who is not familiar with coding,
but I'm not in that category. With a fast search for a beautiful theme, I found this one, which I will modify later to suit
my tastes.

For now I'm trying to learn all formatting codes so I can better organize my thoughts and to play around with colors and design to make it look awesome.
This is all for now :)

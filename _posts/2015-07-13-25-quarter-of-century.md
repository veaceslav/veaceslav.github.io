While I continue to receive messages and notifications on Facebook,
calls from family members and happy birthday emails from co-workers,
I continue to do my usual stuff, like it is a normal day.
When I think about it, birthday was never a special day for me,
I never had huge parties, big cakes and so on. It is just a normal day.
My parents keep asking what present to I want, and I keep telling them
that I need nothing... And yes, since
my parent can't really afford to buy a present which cost few hundred 
euros, I don't like to ask something like that. Everything which I truly
need, I can buy by myself.

Somebody told once that when you grow up, you begin to truly appreciate 
when you get a pair of socks under the Chrismas tree. And now I'm really
happy that I got a nice, red T-Shirt. Of course it is bigger than my size
and I must change it, but man, how cares :))

This is the point where you could contemplate on what did you manage to
achieve in this life, and despite the fact that I didn't get incredibly
rich or something like that, I'm happy that I almost secured my studies
and from this point, I should stop being broke ))
I said almost, because I still need to finish the last year of my master
degree, which means another year of counting every cent and making tight
budgets. But not everything is that bad:

* Bachelor in Computer Science  - done
* Master in Computer Science    - halfway done
* Finding the love of my file   - almost succeded :))
* Money                         - flawless, I'm not in any debt
* Jobs                          - I've got 2 of them
* Health                        - Pretty healthy

That is all that matters, and I'm happy with what I achieved. This doesn't
mean I will stop here, still having some ambitious plans and I hope to implement
them really soon.

p.s. How did I spend the first half of my birthday? Just learned German on Duolingo )

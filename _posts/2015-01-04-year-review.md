Last days of 2014 were incredibly boring. I was so pissed and mad, that I almost
played some Dragon Age: Inquisition till 23:50 without having even the slightest
feel of guilt. Only when my mother told me that we must celebrate, I had to get off
my computer and drink some champagne...Yay! Bu not evefrything was that bad...

When I look back, I can see at least 4 notable achievments that I managed to do,
which were set at the begining of 2014:

* Managed to finish my Bachelor degree at University Politehnica of Bucharest
* Completed my second Google Summer of Code project together with digiKam
project
* Was accepted to study at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, as master parallel and
      distributed systems student, also won VU Fellowship Program
* Got Romanian citizenship

Now, when I come to think about all of them, I was quite successfull in 2014.
And I feel happy again. Because if I only take the first bullet, the bachelor thesis
was no joke and I even signed up to make it with company, so requirements where quite
high.

Moreover, while my Bachelor degree was not yet finished, I had to start working
on my Google Summer of Code project, for digiKam, which also had a pretty close deadline.
Even if original project couldn't be completed, for reasons which where not in my power
to solve, I managed to change the course and push some substantial contribuions.

And together with bachelor thesis hassle, I had to do a lot of paperwork, to prepare
for applying at VU and TUM(Tehnische Universiteit Munchen) for my master degree.
I was rejected by TUM, but I was more than lucky with Vrije Universiteit, because
I also got a scholarship.

Romanian citizenship was also hard to acquire, the whole process started in december
2012 and I finally got my passport less than.. 5 days before I had to go in Netherlands...
Not to mention that after exams, in June, I had to travel 4 times from Bucharest to Chisinau,
more than 2000km, in less than 1 week... by bus.... Yay!

Also, a lot of other minor events happend: travel to Berlin, meet a lot of different people,
a lot of parties and new friends.

To draw a conclusion, 2014 was an amazing year, from the amount of work done and also
a little fun at the end of it. I think I must raise the bar for 2015 even further,
but first... let me think about it!

I'm still trying to get used to new learning scheme enfroced by Vrije Universiteit.
Until now, I used to have 5 different courses, with a lot of assignments and only 3 weeks to prepare for all
5 exams that I had. I don't really miss the old times, when you have 5 days to become an expert in all the course's
theory, but it was more easy to get over all in one shot. Now the 2 months period is almost over and I must prepare
for 2 exams.

First, I want to mention that VU course are more focused on theory and less on practical part. At Politehnica, we had as much as
12 programming assignments during the semester, each of them with a 2 week time to complete and with a lot of overlaps. Here I had
one big assignment, which I could choose to make with another colleague. Even If I wanted to write all code by myself,
it whould take far less time.

So I used extra time to go to all lectures and seminar, also learning a lot of theory in process. Now, when we have no more lectures,
I thought it will be more easy, and I was wrong. Listening all the lectures once again, and doing exercises revealed a lot of gaps in
my knowledge on that specific course.

Lets hope that I will successfully pass my first exams and will come later with more details about them.

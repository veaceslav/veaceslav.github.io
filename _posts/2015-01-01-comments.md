Since New Year Eve was quite boring for me, I decided to make small improvements
to my blog engine. It fits into a different model, called static blog, which
differs from regular wordpress style, by its simplicity.

Yet, simplicity also brings a lot of chanllenges when it comes to enabling some dynamic
features, and one of them is ability to post and display comments.

I used this article to add a semi-automatic blog post comment system.

Semi-automatic because I want to review the comments before allowing them,
so I will have to push them manually. But I don't think it will be so much of a hassle
at the begining...

My to do list include adding some statistics support, to see who is visiting my blog,
but after I will begin to populate it with more content.

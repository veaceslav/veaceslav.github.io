Not my job type of attitude is very common in both Republic of Moldova and Romania.
And everytime I have to deal with this, you must endure both financiar and moral
humilation. For somebody who doesn't know the relationship between Republic of 
Moldova and Romania, both countries used to be together for almost 2 thousand 
years, until they got separated 200 hundred years ago, by "mother Russia".
Propaganda was really strong, but still people living in both countries share
the same language and habits.

In 2007 Romania joined the European Union and this comes with its own perks and
benefits. Unfortunately we, as citizens of Moldova, our international passport is 
not recognized the same way as Romanian, and of course we are not allowed to work,
only 90 days of stay is allowed, given that you have a special document(bio-metric passport)

After certain events which occurred in Moldova in 2009, Romania decided to give 
Romanian citizenship for people which speak Romanian and have an ancestor born
before 1940(until 1940, Moldova was a part of Romania). I applied for citizenship
and after 2 years full of bureaucracy, I got it.

This summer, after returning from my studies in Netherlands, decided to renew my
passport. Went to embassy, waited a little in the line, paid the fee, they took 
a photo and bio-metric data and I went back home. They also gave me a paper which says
that I must come in a certain day to get it, between 13 and 14 o'clock.

Today was the day when I need to go after passport. Was there 15 minutes earlier, just
to be on time. Outside the temperature was over 30 degress in the shadow... I said OK,
and then sat on a bench to wait. It's 13 o'clock and nobody got any passport yet.
People keep coming, there were around 60 persons there.
After 40 minutes of waiting in the most terrible weather, they finally started to give
out passports. When asked why it took so long, they replied: "You know, we needed to collect all receipts"
And here you go, another 30 minutes of sitting in direct sunlinght,until I got my passport and went back home. 

Back home I open the envelope and took a look on my picture:

A beautiful back eye, like a took a beating a day before taking a photo.
Typical not my job style, and somebody might say it is not that important, when looking
at each "issue" separately. And I don't really care about that black eye.
But when you get annoyed constantly and treated like shit, then this is another story

P.s. The price for this passport is 100 E which is 1/5 of average monthly salary in Romania or
1/2 of average montly salary in Republic of Moldova.

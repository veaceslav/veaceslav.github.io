    - {_id: Nzc0Mjg=, comment: 'Richard, the reason why an update is not practical is because digiKam does not know how much time it will take. The same amount of 200 photos sync in less than 1 second on my machine, while it may take 6 minutes on your just because you have your files somewhere over the network. I guess user intervention is required in such scenarios :) Also please post your suggestion on digiKam&#39;s G+ or mailing list, my static blog is not very suited for managing comments and it&#39;s hard for you to follow up, since I have no notification system )', created: '2015-08-25T14:19:15.469Z', email: veaceslav.munteanu90@gmail.com, name: Veaceslav, path: /kde/2015/08/24/advanced-metadata.html, url: "", avatar: '//www.gravatar.com/avatar/488607f5bb87f92f239a507ac0813b55?s=50&r=pg&d=404'}
    - {_id: NzczOTE=, comment: "@Veaceslav: It&#39;s a good feature and I understand your reply, but people not familiair with it may be in for a surprise when closing digikam and with many changes to be written.  It will be good to point this out with a pop up (or something like that) when lots of updates are waiting.\r\n\r\nIs there a progress meter, if so with I hope the number of files (changes) to go and to be done (please don&#39;t express it in percentages, as 50% of 2 files takes much than 50% of 200 files....)\r\n\r\nps: I was talking about updating GPS values, which is much slower than regular tags (only taking a few seconds).\r\n", created: '2015-08-24T19:26:19.151Z', email: "", name: "", path: /kde/2015/08/24/advanced-metadata.html, url: "", avatar: '//www.gravatar.com/avatar/d415f0e30c471dfdd9bc4f827329ef48?s=50&r=pg&d=404'}
    - {_id: NzczODQ=, comment: 'Richard, if it will take 6 minutes for just 200 files, imagine how much it will take to read your whole collection. If you are concerned that digiKam will take long to exit. Then press that &quot;Apply pending&quot; button on status bar from time to time. Let&#39;s say you modified 50 images. You press that button and after that you can go back to your workflow, while metadata is synchronized in background. But the main advantage of lazy sync is that images are syncronized once, but not every single time you modify rating, add tag etc...

    - {_id: NzczODM=, comment: "As you write writing to files on disk can be slow, due to whatever reason.  You also state that digikam writes the changes when exiting.  Does this mean that it sometimes takes a long time, before digikam actually exists (in case when many files are to be updated)?\r\n\r\nIn my case updating &gt; 200 files with GPS (geo) informations that around 6 minutes, I don&#39;t want to wait so long before an application exists...\r\n\r\nIs there a way (an audit) to compare the information in the files (collection) and the database, without actually modifying the database or the files (a kind dry-run)?\r\n", created: '2015-08-24T18:06:26.077Z', email: ml@radoeka.nl, name: Richard, path: /kde/2015/08/24/advanced-metadata.html, url: "", avatar: '//www.gravatar.com/avatar/711a876513da240a65d1b0b30bfab9dd?s=50&r=pg&d=404'}
    - {_id: NzczNzk=, comment: 'Thank you Alan. Tags is more general and namespaces do not store only hierarchical tags. Some of them store keywords, some of them store the full path.

    - {_id: NzczNzY=, comment: 'Nice work Veaceslav!  One question. The screenshot lists the various hierarchical tag properties under simple &quot;Tags&quot;. That seems a bit ambiguous to me. Would it not be useful to specify that these are nested hierarchical tags rather then a simple list of keywords?', created: '2015-08-24T17:09:50.511Z', email: alan.pater@gmail.com, name: Alan, path: /kde/2015/08/24/advanced-metadata.html, url: "", avatar: '//www.gravatar.com/avatar/9dc3c2f58501db320e87a717b1e34f7e?s=50&r=pg&d=404'}

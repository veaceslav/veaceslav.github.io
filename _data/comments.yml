If you are concerned that digiKam will take long to exit. Then press that &quot;Apply pending&quot; button on status bar from time to time. Let&#39;s say you modified 50 images. You press that button and after that you can go back to your workflow, while metadata is synchronized in background. But the main advantage of lazy sync is that images are syncronized once, but not every single time you modify rating, add tag etc...

    - {_id: NzczODM=, comment: "As you write writing to files on disk can be slow, due to whatever reason.  You also state that digikam writes the changes when exiting.  Does this mean that it sometimes takes a long time, before digikam actually exists (in case when many files are to be updated)?\r\n\r\nIn my case updating &gt; 200 files with GPS (geo) informations that around 6 minutes, I don&#39;t want to wait so long before an application exists...\r\n\r\nIs there a way (an audit) to compare the information in the files (collection) and the database, without actually modifying the database or the files (a kind dry-run)?\r\n", created: '2015-08-24T18:06:26.077Z', email: ml@radoeka.nl, name: Richard, path: /kde/2015/08/24/advanced-metadata.html, url: "", avatar: '//www.gravatar.com/avatar/711a876513da240a65d1b0b30bfab9dd?s=50&r=pg&d=404'}
    - {_id: NzczNzk=, comment: 'Thank you Alan. Tags is more general and namespaces do not store only hierarchical tags. Some of them store keywords, some of them store the full path. You will be able to see these, and many other properties if you press edit button.', created: '2015-08-24T17:48:10.262Z', email: veaceslav.munteanu90@gmail.com, name: Veaceslav, path: /kde/2015/08/24/advanced-metadata.html, url: "", avatar: '//www.gravatar.com/avatar/488607f5bb87f92f239a507ac0813b55?s=50&r=pg&d=404'}
    - {_id: NzczNzY=, comment: 'Nice work Veaceslav!  One question. The screenshot lists the various hierarchical tag properties under simple &quot;Tags&quot;. That seems a bit ambiguous to me. Would it not be useful to specify that these are nested hierarchical tags rather then a simple list of keywords?', created: '2015-08-24T17:09:50.511Z', email: alan.pater@gmail.com, name: Alan, path: /kde/2015/08/24/advanced-metadata.html, url: "", avatar: '//www.gravatar.com/avatar/9dc3c2f58501db320e87a717b1e34f7e?s=50&r=pg&d=404'}
